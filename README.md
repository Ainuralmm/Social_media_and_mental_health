And it contains the following files:

_- Jupyter Notebook files with code_

_- Presentation files related to the project_




The Jupyter Notebook code is structured as follows:

**1.Data Pre-processing and Cleaning**

Renaming Columns: Standardizing column names for consistency and readability.

Re-arranging Columns: Organizing columns in a logical order to facilitate analysis.

**2.Missing Value Detection and Treatment**

Identifying Missing Values: Systematically detecting missing data points.

Treating Missing Values: Applying appropriate techniques to handle missing data, such as imputation or removal.

**3.Data Transformation**

Transforming Data: Implementing transformations to normalize or standardize data, as required for analysis.

**4.Summation of Scores**

Aggregating Scores: Calculating the total scores for different aspects of mental well-being.

**5.Adding an "Outcome" Column**

Outcome Labeling: Creating an "Outcome" column to prepare the data for correlation analysis and predictive modeling.

**6.Analysis and Modeling**

Correlation Analysis: Preparing the data for correlation analysis to identify significant relationships.

Logistic Regression: Implementing logistic regression for binary classification tasks.
